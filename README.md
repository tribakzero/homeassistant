# Home Assistant helpers

Helpers around Home Assistant, could be Blueprints for automations and script, maybe setup, no idea. Just drafting things up to have this online.

## Blueprints

### Automations

#### Motion-light with Conditions

This automation blueprint is based on the default one from Home Assistant, but adds Occupancy to the Motion sensor types and adds extra conditions that need to be match before the automation triggers.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftribakzero%2Fhomeassistant%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fconfig%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fmotion_light_with_conditions.yaml)

That's it for the moment.
